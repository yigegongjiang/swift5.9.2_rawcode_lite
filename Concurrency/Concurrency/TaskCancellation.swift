// ==== Task Cancellation ------------------------------------------------------

/// Execute an operation with a cancellation handler that's immediately
/// invoked if the current task is canceled.
///
/// This differs from the operation cooperatively checking for cancellation
/// and reacting to it in that the cancellation handler is _always_ and
/// _immediately_ invoked when the task is canceled. For example, even if the
/// operation is running code that never checks for cancellation, a cancellation
/// handler still runs and provides a chance to run some cleanup code.
///
/// Doesn't check for cancellation, and always executes the passed `operation`.
///
/// The `operation` executes on the calling execution context and does not suspend by itself,
/// unless the code contained within the closure does. If cancellation occurs while the
/// operation is running, the cancellation `handler` will execute *concurrently* with the `operation`.
///
/// ### Already cancelled tasks
/// When `withTaskCancellationHandler` is used in a `Task` that has already been cancelled,
/// the `onCancel` cancellation ``handler`` will be executed immediately before operation gets
/// to execute. This allows the cancellation handler to set some external "cancelled" flag that the
/// operation may be *atomically* checking for in order to avoid performing any actual work once
/// the operation gets to run.
